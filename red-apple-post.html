        <h1>Red Apple</h1>
        <p>
          They are delicious, they are nutritious and a handful may even help keep doctor away.
          The season of apples is here and we can’t wait to have our fill of these juicy and crunchy wonders.
          Whether you have them as a stand alone snack in the middle of a work-filled day or as part of salads,
          smoothies, pies or desserts, apples rarely disappoint. Furthermore, the extensive list of the health benefits that apples offer is hard to ignore.
          High in pectin fibre apples boost metabolic levels, help improve heart health and regulate body’s blood sugar levels by regulating the release of sugar.
          They are also packed with vitamin and minerals that promote healthy bones, teeth and skin.
          Apples are loaded with vitamin C that boosts immunity, keeping any ailment at bay.
          They also consist of healthy polyphenol antioxidants that are essential for overall health.
          In fact, according to a study published in the Journal Planta Medica, animal studies have shown apples and apple juice to be effective in reducing the risk of colon, skin and breast cancers.
          Here are some more benefits of eating apples that will convince you to pick one today. 

          <ol>

            <li>
              <h3>Good for Diabetics and Blood Sugar regulation</h3> 
              <p>According to the book ‘Healing Foods’ by DK Publishing,
                the fructose (a class of sugar) and antioxidant polyphenols in apples improve the metabolic 
                balance and slow the rate at which sugar is absorbed in the body. This property of apples is 
                especially effective for diabetics, who have to keep their blood sugar spike in check. 
                Experts have also suggested that apples lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes because of a class 
                of antioxidants called <em>Anthocyanin</em>, that is also responsible for red, purple and blue colors in fruits 
                and veggies.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <h3>Aids Weight Loss</h3>
              <p>Pectin fibre helps lower the body’s absorption of excess dietary fats.
                The rich quantum of fiber found in apples also helps you feeling full for longer. 
                Bangalore based nutritionist Dr. Anju Sood says, 
                <q> Fibre takes the longest to digest, 
                   which helps you keep satiated and prevents you from binging on other fattening and 
                   sugar laden foods. In the long run, this aids in weight loss.
                </q>
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <h3>Enables Smoother Digestion</h3>
              <p>A number of health benefits of apples are derived from the wonder fibre pectin it contains. 
                This soluble fibre works wonders for your digestion. Pectin a form of soluble fiber, 
                draws water from your digestive tract and forms a gel, helping to slow digestion and 
                pushing stool through your intestines. Apples also contain malic acid, 
                which is again a useful <em>digestive aid</em>. 
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <h3>Helps Relieve Constipation and Diarrhoea</h3>
              <p>The high concentration of pectin fibre not only aids digestion but also regulates 
                 smoother bowel movements. According to the book ‘Healing Foods’, 
                <q> Pectin has an amphoteric action. Paradoxically, it can prove relief from both 
                   constipation and diarrhoea depending on body’s needs. 
                </q> 
                  
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <h3>Protecting bones</h3>
              <p>Apples are also effective in strengthening bones and can play a crucial part in overall bone 
                health. A certain favanoid phlorizin, found in apple skin, may help prevent bone loss 
                associated with menopause, as it fights the inflammation and free radical production that 
                leads to bone degeneration.
